## Problem Statement
In a post-pandemic era, travelling around the globe has emerged as the top priority in various tourists’ agenda, putting the aviation and tourism sectors under the spotlight! As such, curate an application or software that enhances tourists’ experience and/or optimises the operations of the aviation industry.

## Target Audience 

Tourists in any foreign country 

## Core Features 

<li> Tourist Destination Recommender </li>

Allows users to curate their itinerary by selecting their preferred destinations and attractions. The filter helps to tailor the suggestions to users' travelling styles. The recommender is based on users' past swiping history, preferences and commonly visited places by other users. 

<li> Itinerary Planner </li>

Users can arrange the order of activities based on the duration of their stay.

<li> Partnership with Airlines </li>

Optimise the operations of the aviation industry by creating collaboration opportunities with airlines and local businesses to distribute vouchers to users. Partnerships promote airlines as tourists that fly with them are able to redeem vouchers for the activities that they are interested in.

<li> Community Forum </li>

Allows users to write and share reviews about local attractions that they have visited before and gain in-depth and accurate insights from one another, including festive events held at these attractions.

## Setup

### Using React-Native

Keep in mind that this library can cause trouble if you are renaming a project that uses `Pods` on the iOS side.

After that you should proceed as with any javascript project:

- Go to your project's root folder and run `npm install`.
- If you are using Xcode 12.5 or higher got to /ios and execute `pod install --`repo-update`
- Run `npm run ios` or `npm run android` to start your application!
